1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:01,133
okay so

2
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:01,700
today we're gonna be

3
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,733
creating a really cool graphic novel or

4
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:05,066
half toned shader and blender

5
00:00:05,066 --> 00:00:06,900
I'll make this as quick and simple as possible

6
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,400
and if you follow these steps carefully

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,066
we'll be wrapped up within a few minutes

8
00:00:11,566 --> 00:00:14,133
all I've done here is that a UV sphere and a bass mesh

9
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:15,266
nothing too complicated

10
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:15,733
first

11
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:18,066
you're gonna want to go to the shader tab at the top

12
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,400
select everything you want the shader applied to

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,200
create a new shader called Graphic Novel or

14
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,966
whatever you'd like

15
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:26,400
go to the Red World tab at the right hand side

16
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,933
and set the color to black

17
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,133
press shift a and add shader to RGB

18
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,766
press shift a again and add texture coordinate

19
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:35,333
you're also going to want to make sure

20
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,666
that Wrangler is set on preferences

21
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,000
next we'll just add a viewer

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,700
will shift and ctrl on the texture coordinate and

23
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,333
left click so that the window connects to the viewer

24
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,733
press shift a and select Vector Math

25
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,766
change the add to multiply

26
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,166
and if you're noticing a pattern you're not wrong

27
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,933
shift a is our best friend

28
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,666
press shift a again and this time XYZ

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,100
drag the vector to the bottom vector of multiply

30
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:00,533
press shift a again

31
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:01,566
this time value

32
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:03,333
and put it under the texture coordinate

33
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:06,666
connect value to y on the combine XYZ note

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,366
set the value to 100

35
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:11,333
click shift a math change the multiply

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,866
set the value to 1920

37
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,900
1080 or 1.778

38
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,300
this is the resolution size of the screen

39
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,400
connect the value at the top to the X

40
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,800
duplicate multiply and set it to fraction

41
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,100
duplicate fraction and set it to dustance

42
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,366
connect it to the viewer

43
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,266
set the top to vector numbers to no point 5

44
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:33,366
click shift a math and select less than

45
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,666
set its threshold to no point 37

46
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,366
connect shader to RGB color to the threshold

47
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,566
click shift a again

48
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,266
map wrench and connect shader to RGB

49
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:44,666
color to its value

50
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,366
drag result of the threshold

51
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,733
and finally you're just going to want to click on the

52
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,166
green camera icon on the right

53
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,666
and drag a pass part 2

54
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,966
to 1 now you can do whatever you'd like with it

55
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:55,866
you can change the threshold of the dots

56
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,066
you can move around the light

57
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:58,333
you can move around the ball

58
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,533
you know I have got full

59
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,733
control over the effect using the nodes tab

60
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,800
and there you have it

61
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,966
a simple graphic novel

62
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:06,400
shader and blender using some basic geometry notes

63
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,900
all wrapped up in a few minutes
