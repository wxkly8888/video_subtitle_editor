1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:02,299
statement researchers would say no no

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,533
we're only working on machine learning

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,966
because working on AI was seen as way too out there

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:12,466
in 2010 just the very mention of the phrase AGI

5
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:14,399
artificial general intelligence

6
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:17,066
would get you some seriously strange looks

7
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:18,999
and even a cold shoulder

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,666
you're actually building AGI people would say

9
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,199
isn't that something out of science fiction

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,500
people thought it was 50 years away or 100 years away

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,766
if it was even possible

12
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:34,266
at all talk of AI was I guess kind of embarrassing

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,600
people generally thought we were weird

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,933
I guess in some ways we kind of were

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,066
it wasn't long though

16
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:41,733
before AI

17
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:44,599
started beating humans at a whole range of tasks

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,300
that people previously thought were way out of reach

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,666
understanding images

20
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,766
translating languages transcribing
